// To add a new alarm:
//
//   - If the alarm is for a defined issuer with previous alarm defintions,
//     simply add a new Index enumeration for the issuer at the end of its
//     existing section.
//
//   - If the alarm is for a new issuer. Add a new Issuer enumeration at
//     the end of the existing list for the new issuer. Add a new section
//     at the bottom of the Index enumeration for the new issuer. The first
//     value in the section should be set to 500 more than the first value
//     in the previous section (i.e. room for 500 alarm index values per
//     issuer).
//
//   - For any new alarm Index enumerations defined, add a corresponding
//     AlarmDefinition to alarm_definitions in alarmdefinition.cpp.
