  // to write to _peers. This means we may first grab the read lock (to work
  // out what write we want to do). However, we can't upgrade a read lock to a
  // write lock, and we don't want somebody else to write to the peers map
  // whilst in between reading and writing. Therefore a function that wishes to
  // write to the peers map MUST ALSO HAVE HOLD OF THE MAIN THREAD LOCK. This is
  // not policed anywhere (in fact, we can't police it), but that's how these
  // locks should be used.
