/// @class CommunicationMonitor
///
/// Provides a simple mechanism to track communication state for an entity,
/// and manage alarms for error conditions. Intended use case:
///
///   - whenever an entity successfully communicates with a peer, the
///     inform_success() method should be called
///
///   - whenever an entity fails to communicate with a peer, the 
///     inform_failure() method should be called
///
/// If the monitor detects that all comms are failing over a set_confirm_sec
/// interval, an alarm (corresponding to alarm_index and alarm_severity) is
/// generated. Once alarmed the monitor will check for a successful comm. at
/// a clear_confirm_sec interval. Once one is detected, a CLEARED severity
/// alarm (corresponding to alarm_index) is generated. Note that timing is
/// driven by calls to the inform_* methods. As such the intervals will not
/// be very precise at low call volume.
