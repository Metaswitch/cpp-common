  /// Instead of blocking the current thread when doing external operations,

  /// "task" object per request that tracks the state necessary to continue
  /// processing when the callback is triggered.
  ///
  /// This class is an implementation of the handler part of this model.
  ///
  /// It takes two template parameters:
  /// @tparam T the type of the task.
  /// @tparam C Although not mandatory according to the HandlerInterface, in
  ///   practice all handlers have some sort of associated config. This is
  ///   the type of the config object.
