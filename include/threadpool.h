// A thread pool that receives work items on one thread, and passes them to be
// processed on one of a pool of threads.
//
// - Create a subclass of ThreadPool.
// - Create a new instance of this class (called `pool` for example).
// - Call pool->start() to start the pool and create its threads.
// - Call pool->add_work to give the pool work to process.
// - Call pool->stop() to stop the pool and terminate its threads.
// - (optionally) Call pool->join() to wait until the pool is fully stopped.
//
// Note that start may only be called once. Once the pool has been stopped it
// cannot be restarted.
//
// The start(), stop(), and join() methods are not threadsafe and should not be
// called simultaneously.
