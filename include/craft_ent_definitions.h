/// Defines common definitions for PDLog (Problem Definition Log) classes

/// A PDLogBase defines the base class containing:
///   Identity - Identifies the log id to be used in the syslog id field.
///   Severity - One of Emergency, Alert, Critical, Error, Warning, Notice, and Info.
///              Directly corresponds to the syslog severity types.
///              Only Error and Notice are used.  See syslog_facade.h for definitions.
///   Message - Formatted description of the condition.
///   Cause - The cause of the condition.
///   Effect - The effect the condition.
///   Action - A list of one or more actions to take to resolve the condition if it is an error.
/// The elements of the class are used to format a syslog call.
/// The call to output to syslog is in the method,  dcealog.
/// By default syslog limits a total syslog message size to 2048 bytes.  Anything
/// above the limit is truncated.  The fromatted message, cause, effect, and action(s) are
/// concatenated into the syslog message.  Note, as an arbitrary convention, for more
/// than a signle action, the actions are numbered as (1)., (2)., ...  to make the actions
/// easier to read within the syslog message.  syslog removes extra whitespace and
/// carriage-returns/linefeeds before inserting the complete string into a message.
/// Note also, the action(s) are a list of strings with all but the last string having a
/// space character at the end.  The space makes the actions more readable.
/// Most of the derived classes are templates.  The paremeterized types
/// being values that are output as a formatted string in the Message field.
